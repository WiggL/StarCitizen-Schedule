We’re aiming to improve rendering performance by rendering as much of the UI ahead of a frame. For video communications, this will mean that we don’t have to pre-render the comms to store those files on the hard drive (as is the case with most games). This will allow us to maintain fidelity as well as save hard drive space."

Cyrovolcanos have been known to erupt unexpectedly from such crevasses, so be wary when flying at low altitudes. Despite all its danger, there is much beauty to be found on Yela, like the underwater caves hidden beneath the moon’s crust. <!--<img src=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/5yqbc0y8ugvimr/post/Yela_2.gif\" />-->"
